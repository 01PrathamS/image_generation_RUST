# image_generation_RUST

This project focuses on:

- Efficient data processing using Rust
- Training a generative model to synthesize human face images from embeddings

### Task 1: Face Dataset Creation (Rust)

> Goal: Write a Rust program that runs inference on a face detector and crops valid face images from a batch. Use the WIDER FACE dataset and handle edge cases effectively.

While I faced technical issues integrating `opencv` and `torch-sys` crates (cargo could not build them correctly despite several clean builds), I implemented the core face processing logic using Python and focused heavily on the **edge case handling** as required by the task:

- Confidence thresholding (set to 0.83)
- Filtering out blurry images
- Cropping only **frontal** and **single-face** images

These decisions significantly improve the quality and usability of the dataset compared to using raw face detections.

### Task 2: Generative Face Model (PyTorch)

> Goal: Train a generative model that outputs 128Ã—128 face images conditioned on embeddings.

I experimented with multiple generative approaches:

- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: Successfully reconstructed face images and began exploring embedding conditioning.
- **Diffusion Models (DDPM)**: Trained from scratch, but embedding conditioning was **not fully implemented** (can only sample without conditioned image embedding)

### VAE Results
